# Cpu-scheduling-algorithms
Implementation of CPU algorithms including FCFS, RR, and SJF


Hello
In this repository, I implemented three types of CPU scheduling algorithms in Python, each of which I generalized to n processes.
This repository is for simulation only and has been my operating system lesson project ...
I hope it will be useful
